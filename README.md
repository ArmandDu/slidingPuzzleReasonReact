# ReasonReact - Sliding Puzzle

A small sliding puzzle game written in ReasonReact.

### Motivation

I wanted to try out the ReasonReact language with a small project.

Try out the [ReasonReact version](https://puzzle.apptize.fr)
or [React version](https://puzzle.apptize.fr/?v=react).

The [React Repo](https://github.com/ArmandDu/slidingPuzzleReact)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Run it locally

```bash
# git clone https://github.com/ArmandDu/slidingPuzzleReasonReact
# npm install
# npm start
``` 

### Build with Docker

```bash
# git clone https://github.com/ArmandDu/slidingPuzzleReasonReact
# npm install
# npm run build
# docker build -t <image_name> .
```
